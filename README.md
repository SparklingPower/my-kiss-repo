# my-kiss-repo

This is my personal repo for my current kiss linux installation:

The only (working) packages as of the today (April 7th 2020) are:

- OpenSSH patched for tab completions and working terminal prompt
- libedit as a dependency of OpenSSH for the aforementioned patch
- sowm with normal window close,keyboard move/resize patches and minus some keybindings (since I'm using sxhkd for that)

everything else is work in progress
