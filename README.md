# my-kiss-repo

This is my personal repo for my current kiss linux installation:

The only (working) packages as of the today (April 7th 2020) are:

- OpenSSH patched for tab completions and working terminal prompt
- libedit as a dependency of OpenSSH for the aforementioned patch

everything else is work in progress
